# X32: Basic Setup
Note: These instructions are primarily intended for the X32 Rack unit, with an S16 Digital Snake for musician connections.

## Connecting to the X32
1.  Turn the X32 Rack on.

2.  Open X32 edit, navigate to the 'Setup' screen, and the 'Network' tab. Enter the IP address of the X32 unit, click out of the field and it should detect the X32 unit. Click the Connect button.

3.  It should then ask you if you want to sync details from the X32 to your PC, or from the PC to the X32 unit. You generally want to select 'Console -> PC', unless you have already setup your PC ready for this setup:

    The system will now sync the system. ***Don't touch the laptop until this process is completed - I've found the app can crash if you alt-tab away or switch to another program while it's transferring settings.***

## Setup for a band service
1.  Roll out the digital snake, plug it in to network and power, turn it on.

2.  In X32 Edit, navigate to the 'Setup' screen, and the 'Config' tab. Select '**AES50A**' from the Synchronization section:

## Setup for a simple service (no S16 Digital Snake needed)
1.  In X32 Edit, navigate to the 'Setup' screen, and the 'Config' tab. Select '**Local**' from the Synchronization section (see above screenshot).
